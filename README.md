# Sprites-as-a-Service

This is an 8-bit pixel art style sprite generator, suitable for avatars.  This is a JavaScript implementation based on the technique used by Lj V. Miranda for: [Sprites-as-a-Service](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/sprites-as-a-service).  As such, it may easily be run client-side or server-side.
